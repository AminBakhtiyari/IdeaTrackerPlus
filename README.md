# IdeasTracker: Projects & Tasks

<b>A TO-DO LIST FOR YOUR IDEAS:</b>

IdeasTracker is an entirely free and open source idea, task and project management app helping you keep track of your great ideas. Almost like a To-Do list, but more relax: no annoying reminder, or big red “overdue task” notification.
Your ideas/tasks are clearly separated by project, no need for tags or filters, you can simply focus on one project at a time.
